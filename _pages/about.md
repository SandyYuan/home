Welcome to my website. I am a KIPAC Post-doctoral Fellow in Astrophysics at Stanford. I am interested in a wide range of topics in physical and observational cosmology. I am currently working with Prof. Risa Wechsler, Prof. Daniel Eisenstein, and Prof. Tom Abel on Bayesian simulation-based inference from non-linear scale structure, novel cosmological statistics, and galaxy-halo connection models. Some of my favorite topics include cosmological simulations, machine learning, generative AI, Bayesian statistics, redshift-space distortions, halo occupation models, assembly bias, nearest-neighbor statistics, and gravitational lensing. We are also broadly interested in methodologies that improve clustering measurements and their interpretations.

I have also been a member of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, where I chaired the simulation working group for two consecutive terms. We recently released our Year 1 results. It caused a bit of a splash ;) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/science/space/astronomy-universe-dark-energy.html">

I completed my PhD in Astrophysics with Prof. Daniel Eisenstein at Harvard in 2021. Before that, I got my Bachelors degree in Astrophysics at Princeton, where I worked on various exciting projects such as identifying obscured quasars in SDSS, looking for ultra diffuse galaxies in HSC, and simulating progenitor gas clouds in the early Universe. 

I have been widely involved in teaching and outreach. At Harvard, I was a teaching assistant for ASTRO 17 and ASTRO 130. I was a founding member of Open Labs At Harvard, with the goal of promoting science and research education among underpriviledged K-12 students in the Greater Boston area. Aside from work, I enjoy tennis, DJing, and cooking.  

My Chinese name is 袁思涵, listen here for the correct pronunciation: <a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=%E8%A2%81%E6%80%9D%E6%B6%B5&op=translate"> Google Pronounce </a>. But you can also just call me Sandy.
